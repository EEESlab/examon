msgid "The mqtt protocol is based on the principle of publishing messages and subscribing to topics, or \"pub/sub\". Multiple clients connect to a broker and subscribe to topics that they are interested in. Clients also connect to the broker and publish messages to topics. Many clients may subscribe to the same topics and do with the information as they please. The broker and mqtt act as a simple, common interface for everything to connect to. This means that you if you have clients that dump subscribed messages to a database, to twitter, pachube or even a simple text file, then it becomes very simple to add new sensors or other data input to a database, twitter or so on."

Messages may be sent at any QoS level, and clients may attempt to subscribe to topics at any QoS level. This means that the client chooses the maximum QoS it will receive. For example, if a message is published at QoS 2 and a client is subscribed with QoS 0, the message will be delivered to that client with QoS 0. If a second client is also subscribed to the same topic, but with QoS 2, then it will receive the same message but with QoS 2. For a second example, if a client is subscribed with QoS 2 and a message is published on QoS 0, the client will receive it on QoS 0."
